Import Zip
==========

This command allows to import a zip-archived file produced by Mica. The result of the import will be the creation or the update of the packaged documents and their attachments.

.. code-block:: bash

  mica import-zip  <CREDENTIALS> [EXTRA] PATH

A very useful usage of this command is when a series of associated documents should be imported together. For instance, this command permits to import an individual-study, its network and all its associated collected-datasets. Here is how the documents should be organized into sub-folders and archived such that the import command recognizes it as a valid input:

.. code-block:: text

  - study
    - individual-study-name
      - network-something.json
      - collected-dataset1.json
      - collected-dataset2.json
      - collected-dataset3.json
      - individual-study-name.json
      - attachments
        - attachment-id1
        - attachment-id2

.. note::

  attachment-id is the ID used in the document attachments list in the JSON file, this should not be the filename.

.. warning::

  Use this command with special care to prevent overriding existing documents and breaking associations.
