Drupal Introduction
===================

`Drupal <http://drupal.org/>`_ is a Content Management System (CMS) allowing to build a web portal with a friendly administration interface and with extensible capabilities. What is referred to Mica Drupal Client in this documentation consists of a set of Drupal modules and theme. These modules/theme will get the published data from the Mica server (through its web services) and will deliver them as Drupal pages. Drupal supports user authentication which is itself extended to use Agate user directory. This way Drupal users can authenticate on Agate and get the Mica pages adapted to their permissions.

This guide describes how to set up a Drupal server with Mica client modules/theme configured. It is intended for the the system administrators.
